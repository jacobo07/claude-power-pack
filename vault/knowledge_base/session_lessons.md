# Session Lessons — Atomic Learning

Append-only log of concrete, non-derivable learnings per session.
One entry per `/kclear` with a `lesson` field. Keep each entry short and
self-contained — if a future reader can't grok it without the conversation,
rewrite it.

## 2026-04-22 — Shipped 5 MC-OVO cycles on claude-power-pack: sleepless_qa atomic landing (34 fi

**Session:** `kpp-supremacy-v7000-marathon`

Before promoting any inline-one-liner failure to an audit recommendation, run the canonical tool (--help / official CLI). Mistake #52: my ad-hoc script's bug got misattributed to the audited file.

## 2026-05-14 — Stop-hook PATH: bare `python` resolves to Store stub on Win11

**Session:** `kobiidistilleros-genesis-v82000`

Stop-chain hooks were emitting "command not found" because `hook-utils.js#getPythonCommand` returned bare `python` on win32. Windows 11's PATH includes a Microsoft Store stub `python.exe` that exits non-zero (it opens the Store), not the real interpreter under `%LOCALAPPDATA%\Programs\Python\Python3*\python.exe`. Inline copies of the same pattern existed in `kobiiclaw-autoresearch.js`, `baseline-translator.js`, `dna-flywheel.js`, `session-init.js`.

Fix: `getPythonCommand()` now probes in priority — `$CLAUDE_PYTHON` → `%LOCALAPPDATA%\Programs\Python\Python3*\python.exe` → `py -3` → bare `python`. Memoized after first resolution. Added matching `getNodeCommand()` returning `process.execPath` to neutralize the same risk for bare-`node` shell-outs. `kobiiclaw-autoresearch.js` (the Stop-chain offender) migrated to call the helper.

**Vaccine:** never write `const x = process.platform === 'win32' ? 'python' : 'python3'` inline; always import the helper. Reviewers reject bare-interpreter execSync templates outright.

## 2026-05-14 — Stop-hook schema: no `hookSpecificOutput`, top-level fields only

**Session:** `kobiidistilleros-22-section-singularity-v210000`

Earlier RAM Shield + voice-gate cycles emitted `hookSpecificOutput: {hookEventName: "Stop", additionalContext: "..."}` on Stop events. The harness rejects every such payload with "Hook JSON output validation failed", drops the advisory, and floods the validation log. The schema constraint is: Stop hooks accept ONLY `{continue, suppressOutput, stopReason, decision, reason, systemMessage}` at top level. `hookSpecificOutput` is valid for PreToolUse / UserPromptSubmit / PostToolUse / PostToolBatch — NOT Stop. The canonical re-engagement pattern when a Stop hook needs the model to keep working is `decision: "block" + reason` (see `modules/zero-crash/hooks/context-watchdog.py:209-216`). `systemMessage` is the correct field for UI-visible advisories on Stop (see `modules/zero-crash/hooks/ram-watchdog.js:135-142` and the post-patch `ram-shield.js:213-223`).

**Audit pass:** Glob'd `~/.claude/hooks/*.{js,py}` + `~/.claude/skills/**/hooks/*.{js,py}` and enumerated the 10-entry Stop chain in `settings.json:206-303` by name. Every Stop hook either never used `hookSpecificOutput` or already cited the schema constraint in a header comment. Zero patches needed beyond ram-shield.js (Owner-patched today). Earlier memory entry `BL-0040` incorrectly generalized "additionalContext IS supported on Stop" — that claim was true for PreToolUse, not Stop. Correction landed in this entry.

**Vaccine:** When emitting JSON from a Stop hook, treat any field outside the top-level six as schema-poison. Cite `context-watchdog.py:207-209` in the hook header so future contributors don't re-introduce the bug. `BL-0040` superseded.

## 2026-05-14 — Voice gate enforcement: global scope, exit 5, anchor-OR-blacklist

**Session:** `kobiidistilleros-22-section-singularity-v210000`

KobiiDistillerOS v1.2 ships `voice_gate.mode: "enforcing"` in `schema.json`. Validator implementation (`validate.py#_check_voice_gate`) aggregates every materialized section body, strips code fences (so contract docs enumerating the blacklist by name don't trip the gate), and counts hits across two lists:

- `blacklist_candidates` — corporate vocabulary (KPI, synergy, leverage, stakeholder, roadmap, paradigm shift, holistic, …).
- `anchors_candidates` — nostalgic / Refugio-voice tokens (Refugio, MCPE, 2014, cabaña, linterna, Helsinki, KobiiCraft, Andorra, …).

Exit 5 fires **iff** ≥1 blacklist hit AND 0 anchor hits across the **entire** output (global scope per `voice_gate.scope: "global"`). The OR semantic was chosen over AND because:

- A document with anchors + blacklist may be a deliberate translation of corporate-vocabulary readers into Refugio voice (legitimate use case).
- A document with no blacklist + no anchors is "neutral" and shouldn't be punished.
- A document with blacklist + zero anchors is the exact failure mode the gate exists to catch: corporate vocabulary winning, Refugio losing.

**Vaccine:** Voice gates that scan per-section are too strict (most sections legitimately don't reference 2014 / Refugio). Global scope is the right granularity. When wiring the next voice-shaped contract, default to aggregation across the unit-of-distribution (here: the 22-section dataset; for other systems: the PR diff, the commit body, the released chapter).

## 2026-05-14 — 22-section schema expansion + Tandas & Partes structural contract

**Session:** `kobiidistilleros-22-section-singularity-v210000`

Schema v1.2.1 expanded the canonical Mother Prompt from 19 to **22 sections** by adding the Sovereignty layer (§14-16: Cognitive Mirror, Decision Traceability, Antifragilidad) and the Cashflow/Telemetría/Outside-the-Box trio (§20-22). §22 was fused at Owner direction: "Inferencia Decisional Exógena & Conocimiento Negativo (Outside-the-Box Time-Saver)" — outside-the-box inference IS the harvest mechanism for inheriting other people's negative knowledge.

A new top-level block `tandas_partes_spec` declares the structural contract every materialized section MUST honor:

- 3 **depth-tandas** (`### Tanda T1` Baseline / `### Tanda T2` Chase-Gain / `### Tanda T3` Síntesis & Ventaja Estructural).
- 3 **orthogonal partes** per tanda (`#### Parte I` Narrativa / `#### Parte II` Estructura / `#### Parte III` ROI).
- Validator enforces both marker regexes (`tanda_heading_regex`, `parte_heading_regex`) per section file. Missing any tanda or parte → exit 1.

The §2 native "POR TANDAS" semantic (quick-wins / structural / arquitectura) collapses cleanly onto the depth-tanda axis: T1 = quick wins, T2 = structural, T3 = arquitectura. No duplication, no conflict.

**Vaccine:** When a schema names a structural concept twice (the §2 title "POR TANDAS" pre-existed; the structural layer reuses "Tandas"), explicitly map the older concept onto the newer abstraction in BOTH the schema description block AND the Mother Prompt instructions. Future readers will hit the collision and need the bridge documented inline. Done here in `parts/sleepy/distiller.md` §2 body and `schema.json#description`.

## 2026-05-14 — RAM Shield (BL-0033 RAM channel)

**Session:** `kobiidistilleros-consolidation-v82001`

Two-stage RAM management for 30+h unattended sessions. `ram-watchdog.js` already advised at 1500 MB ("consider /kclear"). New `ram-shield.js` adds an *active* 2 GB trip: append a timestamped snapshot block to `<cwd>/vault/progress.md` (or `.claude/progress.md` fallback, or `~/.claude/state/progress.md` global), emit a `systemMessage` carrying the exact `/compact focus on …` line (task summary auto-derived from `git log -1 --pretty=%s`), and emit `hookSpecificOutput.additionalContext` with the literal `CONTEXT THRESHOLD CROSSED` phrase so BL-0033 fires Claude's next-turn `/compact` emission. Live empirical: 20 claude.exe procs at 7 GB tripped cleanly on smoke (synthetic session ID kept the real session's debounce flag clean).

**Schema-field uncertainty:** `ram-watchdog.js` header claims `additionalContext` is rejected on Stop; memory `BL-0040` claims it IS supported. `ram-shield.js` emits BOTH `systemMessage` (reliable) and `additionalContext` (BL-0033 channel) — if the harness drops the latter, the former still surfaces the human-readable instruction. **Vaccine:** when two governance artifacts disagree on a harness schema, ship both and let the harness pick.

**Process-name resolution:** `tasklist /FI "IMAGENAME eq claude.exe"` matches Claude Code on Windows (verified, not inferred — `ram-watchdog.js` already uses it). `process_name_candidates` config array `["claude.exe","claude","claude-code"]` covers Posix + future renames.

**CWD-relative snapshot path:** Stop hook stdin carries `cwd`; resolve project-local first (`vault/progress.md` then `.claude/progress.md`), global fallback last (`~/.claude/state/progress.md`). Never assume `process.cwd()` is the project root inside a hook.
