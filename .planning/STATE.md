# STATE — claude-power-pack

milestone: v1
milestone_name: continuation-proven-live

**Active milestone:** v1 `continuation-proven-live`
**Mode:** EXECUTION. The continuation machinery is built and unit-proven; what
remains is producing the live evidence and clearing the debts that attempt
exposed.
**Date:** 2026-09-19 · **Branch:** `feature/knowledge-acquisition`

## Mission

An unattended run must survive its own context wall: cross it, compact, and
re-enter itself through a continuation that reaches the session that owns it or
nobody at all. The autocompact thresholds are session-scoped so a running
session can narrow its own wall; the resume is typed by the terminal inbox that
owns the pane, never into whichever window has focus; and a resume counts only
when the transcript shows the command was really submitted.

## Where it stands

- Session-scoped autocompact thresholds: **landed**. `_thresholds(session_id)`
  reads `~/.claude/state/ctxwd-thresholds-<sid>.json` ahead of the launch-time
  env knob, under one shared validation rule. `tools/test_gsd_long_run.py`
  60/60; two mutations driven (file source removed → 57/60, session id not
  delivered to the accessor → 59/60), both restores verified by SHA-256.
- Terminal-inbox delivery into this pane: **measured live**. An owned but
  expired request was refused by the extension that owns this terminal, and a
  control request with foreign ancestors was ignored.
- A run that crossed a wall twice and came back: **not yet produced**. Every
  marker on this host reads `UNPROVEN` or `NO_CROSSINGS`.

## Phases

- Phase 1: Two-pane exactness drill — PENDING
- Phase 2: UserPromptSubmit chain deadline — PENDING
- Phase 3: Promote the exact-target lessons — PENDING
- Phase 4: Reap the stale autorun markers — PENDING

The narrow-wall proof is the milestone's acceptance gate, not a phase: it is
produced by this run crossing its own wall while executing the phases above,
and read off `gsd_long_run.py report`.
