# Angular Hooks

> This file extends [common/hooks.md](../common/hooks.md) with Angular specific content.

## PostToolUse Hooks

Configure in `~/.claude/settings.json`:

- **Prettier**: Auto-format `.ts` and `.html` files after edit
- **ESLint / ng lint**: Run `ng lint` after editing Angular source files to catch decorator misuse, template errors, and style violations
- **TypeScript check**: Run `tsc --noEmit` after editing `.ts` files
- **Build check**: Run `ng build` after generating or significantly changing Angular code to catch template and type errors early

## Stop Hooks

- **Lint audit**: Run `ng lint` across modified files before session ends to catch any outstanding violations
